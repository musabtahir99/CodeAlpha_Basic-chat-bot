# Basic Chatbot

A simple **rule-based chatbot** built in Python. It responds to greetings, small talk, and basic questions like your name or age using if-elif-else conditions. Runs in the console, remembers the userâ€™s name once introduced, and demonstrates loops, string handling, and basic natural language interaction.
